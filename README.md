## Description

Singapore being an international and multicultural hub, there are many reasons why people would learn a foreign language. The question is, which school offers the right balance of learning experience, schedule and cost? This site aims to allow people who have studied in a language school to share their experiences with those who are looking to start their language journey.

* Each language lists out which schools offer it

![Language Page]()

* Each school page has description and reviews
