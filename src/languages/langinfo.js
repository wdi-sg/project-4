    country: 'Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein',
    speakers: '95 million people',
    easy: 'Uses the latin script and shares many similar words with English, What you read is what you speak',
    hard: 'The Grammer!, 1. 3 genders (die, das, der), 2. 4 cases (Nominativ, Akkusativ, Dativ, Genitiv), 3. Word order: German sentences have a strange habit of throwing verbs to the end of long sentences, or separating one verb and putting the pieces at opposite ends of the sentence. 4. Plurals: There is very little pattern to turning singular nouns into plurals, so you almost have to learn every noun twice.',
    why: '1. Germany is an economic powerhouse, 2. Low tuition fees in German universities, 3. Germans are everywhere'

  japanese: {
    country: 'Japan',
    speakers: '125 million speakers',
    easy: 'The pronunciation is standard so it is easy to pick at the language at the beginning',
    hard: 'It has 3 scripts to learn (Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji) also for each Kanji character there are multiple ways to read it, 3 levels of formality (casual, formal, business formal) of which the business formal is like a different vocabulary altogether',
    why: '1. There are many Japanese companies across the world, 2. Japan has a very unique and interesting culture'
